3. Use CupertinoActivityIndicator as circular progress indicator.
4. When uploading a new profile image, display an animated circular progress indicator in the center of the img with the edit pencil icon in the center of the indicator. You already built an animated indicator in old jima. Use flutter_uploader package for this.
